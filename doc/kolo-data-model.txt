Intro to Kolo Data Model

There are two main entities in the Kolo project: 
a) person: a member of the academic staff with a description of their professional position, profile, projects and assets
b) a call for collaboration: the description of a person you'd like to collaborate with on some projects

On closer inspection the two entities are essentially 'positions': a person is an current running position and a collaboration is a potential or prospective one. Conceptually the two entities have therefore a lot in common. We decided to exploit those similarities in the data model by having a single schema for the database document that describes a person or a collaboration.

We chose CouchDB to store the data. It is a 'NoSQL' (i.e. non-relational) system where each records is represented as a JSON document. This allows more flexibility in the schema (the schema is actually free and extensible rather than enforced) and is more amenable to Javascript consumption.

See person.json for an example of two person documents. 

See kolo-data-definition.xlsx for more detailed description of the fields and how to use them for either a person or a collaboration.
